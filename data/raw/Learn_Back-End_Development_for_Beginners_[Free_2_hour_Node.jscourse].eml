Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time:

1. freeCodeCamp just published this beginner-friendly back-end development =
course. You'll learn how to build your own web servers and APIs using Node.=
js, Express, and MongoDB. freeCodeCamp's website and mobile apps are built =
using these tools, which make up the popular MERN stack. You'll also get so=
me exposure to database architecture, security principles, testing best pra=
ctices, and more. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/new=
s/intro-to-backend-web-development-nodejs-express-mongodb/

2. freeCodeCamp also published a comprehensive Blender and Three.js course =
where you'll build your own 3D portfolio piece: a render of an adorable hom=
e office. If you're interested in 3D rendering and computer graphics, this =
is the course for you. You'll learn key concepts like Quad Topology, Raycas=
ting, OrbitControls, and more. By the end of the course, your 3D model will=
 be live on the web so you can share it with your friends. (9 hour YouTube =
course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-cute-room-portfolio-wit=
h-threejs-blender-javascript/

3. On this week's freeCodeCamp podcast I had the honor of interviewing Harv=
ard CS50 professor David J. Malan. Over the years, freeCodeCamp has publish=
ed many of his computer science courses, which millions of people have now =
taken. I was hyped to ask him how he uses emerging LLM tools, and where he =
thinks the software engineering field is heading. I had a LOT of questions =
for him and he answered all of them. (1 hour watch or listen in your favori=
te podcast app): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/harvard-cs50-prof-david-=
j-malan-on-why-you-should-learn-programming-slowly-podcast-197/

4. freeCodeCamp also published a handbook on using Docker with Node.js. You=
'll learn how to set up Docker and Docker Compose. You'll also learn fundam=
ental concepts like Volumes, Images, and Containers. This is an excellent r=
esource for you to read through and code along with. Bookmark it for future=
 reference. (full length handbook): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-t=
o-use-to-docker-with-nodejs-handbook/

5. Level up your JavaScript implementation skills with this new freeCodeCam=
p course on Clean Code. You'll learn how to detect =E2=80=9Ccode smells=E2=
=80=9D and refactor your JavaScript accordingly. You'll also learn how to u=
se ESLint and Prettier to automate some of the more error-prone aspects of =
shipping code. (1 hour watch): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/level-up-y=
our-javascript-detect-smells-and-write-clean-code/

It's hard to believe that 2025 is almost over. The freeCodeCamp community i=
s hard at work on a ton of new courses that we'll ship over the next few we=
eks. We're going to ensure that everybody has plenty to learn over the holi=
day break. If you're feeling generous, please consider supporting our chari=
ty and our mission so we can do even more: https://www.freecodecamp.org/don=

Quote of the Week:=20
=E2=80=9CThere=E2=80=99s something liberating about realizing that at the e=
nd of the day everything reduces to zeros and ones. It=E2=80=99s not magic.=
 And once students see that, they think: OK, I got this.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94=

Until next week, happy coding.
